# Christmas Trope Squares

This will host our Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable)) for Christmas Trope Squares.

The basis of the website/app is to allow people to play Christmas Trope BINGO on their phones and online. As well, to allow them to print them off.

We'll start by following the Mozilla PWA guide and tutorial located here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable

# TODO

- [ ] Logo and stuff
  - [ ] Seems there is a 192px version needed for the icons?
  - [x] generate through krita + AI
    - generated 512.png
    - used "christmas and people watching tv with paper in their hands" as the prompt
- [ ] Add an 'Install' button to the website to install the PWA
  - [ ] Test on Android
  - [ ] Test on Web
  - [ ] Test on iOS
- [x] Ask AI / Reddit what PWA enabled js framework should I use
  - SVELTE or Next.js / react, I guess I'll try svelte
