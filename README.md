# Christmas Trope Squares

This will host our Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable)) for Christmas Trope Squares.

The basis of the website/app is to allow people to play Christmas Trope BINGO on their phones and online. As well, to allow them to print them off.

We'll start by following the Mozilla PWA guide and tutorial located here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable
